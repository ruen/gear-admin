  text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too –
    one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives.
    We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.

about:
  heading: What is Gear?
  text: Gear is a network that makes deploying on Polkadot as easy & efficient as
    possible. Gear’s platform will enable developers to build dApps on both
    Polkadot and Kusama, to take advantage of the benefits of their respective
    ecosystems, without the significant financial and time expenses developers
    have dealt with traditionally.

    The main engine of the Gear network is its smart contract module. With Gear,
    all smart contracts are WebAssembly programs that can be compiled in the
    developers’ programming language of choice.


    As a result, Gear provides a low barrier of entry for developers who are new to blockchain, and makes it much easier to experiment creatively with smart contracts


    Gear’s smart contract architecture uses the actor model under the hood, and provides:

    Conventional methods of launching dApps on the Polkadot ecosystem require
    developers to either launch on a pre-existing parachain, or successfully
    become a parachain themselves. The difficulty with becoming a Polkadot
    parachain is that there is an extremely high entry cost, as thousands of
    projects are competing against each other to win one of a limited number of
    slots. On top of that deploying as a parachain can be very time consuming,
    and in some cases it can even take up to a year!


    However by deploying with Gear, developers can launch their dApps easily & efficiently and enter the highly interoperable Polkadot ecosystem without having to win an auction or become a parachain. This means that developers can launch on the powerful Polkadot network without the significant financial and time expenses that are normally required.


    Gear makes deploying your dApps cheap, fast and efficient.
