As blockchain technology is actively gaining traction, it is important to keep up to date with the most recent innovations in the field. At Gear, we provide a cutting edge solution for smart contracts on Polkadot and we want the best engineers to be contributing to our rapidly expanding ecosystem.

That’s why we conducted a series of workshops at the best STEM universities and blockchain-related organizations in the world to raise awareness about our outstanding technology.

Following our first offline workshop in Russia, our team recently held the first online workshop in the United States, where students from the Computer Science and Engineering Society of the University of California San Diego were introduced to Gear’s technology.
