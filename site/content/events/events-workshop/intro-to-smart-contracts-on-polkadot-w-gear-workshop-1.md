As blockchain technology is actively gaining traction, it is important to keep up to date with the most recent innovations in the field. At Gear, we provide a cutting edge solution for smart contracts on Polkadot and we want the best engineers to be contributing to our rapidly expanding ecosystem.

Thatâ€™s why we conducted a series of workshops at the best STEM universities and blockchain-related organizations in the world to raise awareness about our outstanding technology.
