We’re happy to announce that we’ll be hosting the last online workshop in 2021 for the Chinese community.

At the workshop, we will give a detailed introduction to Gear and show you how to deploy simple smart contracts on the Gear platform.

We’ll also show you how to create a simple, decentralized Twitter by using Gear.
