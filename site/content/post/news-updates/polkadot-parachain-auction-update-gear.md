Last Wednesday, at the Substrate developer conference, Polkadot announced that almost five years after it’s whitepaper was written, parachains are finally ready for launch. On the 11th of November 2021, the Polkadot Parachain Auction process will kick off, where projects will be allocated slots for building on the Polkadot network. This is an important milestone in fulfilling the initial vision for Polkadot — to build a truly interconnected and interoperable blockchain network.

In this article, we’ll explain what parachains are, what updates were provided at the conference and how GEAR fits in with the news that parachains are ready for launch!
