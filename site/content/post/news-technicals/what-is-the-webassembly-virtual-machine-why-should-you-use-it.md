Key Takeaway — WebAssembly is a game-changing technology. It allows developers to build applications for the web that can run at near-native speeds. It combines highly optimized code with very small binaries that enables large applications to run very fast and smoothly via the web. This improved speed and efficiency, combined with the possibility of user interaction without download or installation processes is why WebAssembly is being called “the future of the web”.

Imagine a world where you can build software with any programming language and deliver that software to the end user directly in a web browser, without any installation and with near native performance. This development utopia, that once seemed unimaginable, recently became a reality with the introduction of WebAssembly (WASM for short).
