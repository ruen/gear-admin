What is Polkadot?

Polkadot is attempting to take the revolutionary promise of blockchain technology to the next level by providing a way for multiple different blockchains to interact with each other on a singular network that enables secure and scalable cross-chain communication.

Polkadot is an advanced blockchain that unites multiple different blockchains into a unified, scalable network. This means that Polkadot essentially enables different blockchain networks to communicate with each other. This is also known as interoperability.
