**Overview**

WebAssembly (WASM) is a standard developed by W3C Community Group, which defines a low-level binary code format for executable programs that run in browsers. While it was developed to enable high-performance applications to run in browsers, it can also run as a standalone virtual machine.

WebAssembly executables are precompiled, which makes it possible to use a wide variety of programming languages to build and run applications in browsers. There are no preferences for languages and currently dozens of languages can compile to, or have their VMâ€™s, in WASM. Moreover, WASM is hardware-independent and it can be compiled on any modern architectures, desktops and even mobile devices, albeit with some limitations.
