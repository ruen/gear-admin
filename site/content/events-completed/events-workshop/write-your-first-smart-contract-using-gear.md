Following a series of workshops in Russia, we held another workshop for the students of BMSTU. We provided a detailed overview of Web3 technologies and explained how to develop decentralized applications. The attendees showed brilliant knowledge of programming and they all successfully deployed their first smart contract using the Gear platform. Weâ€™d like to say a big thank you to all the participants and we hope to see you again at our future events!
