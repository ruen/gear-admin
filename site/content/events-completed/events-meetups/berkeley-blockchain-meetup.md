Blockchain @ Berkeley is one of the most well-known crypto communities in the Bay Area. At GEAR, we strive to extend the reach of Web 3.0 to every developer and enthusiast, and therefore we gave a presentation on all things blockchain as a part of the Blockchain @ Berkeley monthly meetup. The attendees learned about our mission, the journey of creating GEAR and the basics of smart contracts and decentralization.
