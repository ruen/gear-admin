At GEAR Labs, we aim to educate blockchain enthusiasts by hosting meetups in the Bay Area twice a month.

At this meetup, we will cover a variety of topics starting from Web 3.0 all the way to in-depth Smart Contract development. We will host a Q&A session with our Co-Founder as well!

See you there :)
