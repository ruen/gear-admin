Gear is a self contained blockchain network and the most advanced smart contract platform on the Polkadot and Kusama network. It enables developers to deploy decentralized applications in the easiest and most efficient ways possible. On Gear, all smart contracts are WebAssembly programs that are compiled in different programming languages. Because of this, the barrier to entry for dApp developers is lowered as developers thatâ€™re not so familiar with typical blockchain-based programming languages can build decentralized applications in environments with familiar programming languages.

Gear enables dApps to enter the promising Polkadot ecosystem without having to win an auction or become a parachian. This means that developers can negate the extremely high entry costs of entering the Polkadot ecosystem and deploy much, much quicker.
