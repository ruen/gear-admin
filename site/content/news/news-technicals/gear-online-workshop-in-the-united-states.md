Following our first offline workshop in Russia, our team recently held the first online workshop in the United States, where students from the Computer Science and Engineering Society of the University of California San Diego were introduced to GEARâ€™s technology.

GEAR Tech Lead Daniel Kubatko delivered a presentation where he introduced the students to the Polkadot platform and explained the outstanding issues that GEAR aims to address. Daniel also provided a high-level overview of the vision behind Web3 and how applications are deployed on blockchain technology, which is essential knowledge for understanding the fundamentals of Polkadot and GEAR.
