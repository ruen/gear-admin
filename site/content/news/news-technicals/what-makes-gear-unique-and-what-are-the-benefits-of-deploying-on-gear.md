A brief history of the internetâ€¦

Web 1.0 was the very first iteration of the internet. This era can primarily be categorised by static websites that could only display information. This would allow users to browse, but not interact with data on a website. This ultimately meant that use cases for Web 1.0 technology were severely limited. Essentially, users of Web 1.0 technologies were passive consumers of content.

As we moved into the late 90s, search engines like Google started to introduce new possibilities to the internet. This enabled websites to become more interactive. This iteration of web technologies introduced much more improved and sophisticated user interfaces that were much more interactive and immersive. Now, we could build actual interactive applications instead of just displaying content online. Social networking and ecommerce exploded thanks to these new possibilities and this era of the web can be defined as Web 2.0.
